    """
    When constucting a form wizard, the wizard needs to be composed of a
    sequental series of steps in which it is to display forms to the user and
    collect the data from those forms. To be able to provide these forms to the
    :ref:`SessionWizard <api_sessionwizard>`, you must first wrap the Django
    :class:`django.forms.Form` in a ``Step`` object. The ``Step`` object gives
    the ability to store the :class:`django.forms.Form` class to be used, as
    well as, a unique slug to be used in the wizard navigation.

    .. versionadded:: 0.1

    :param slug:
        Each step in the wizard should have a unique "slug" that identifies that
        ``Step`` in the process. By using slugs the wizard has the ability to go
        forward, as well as, back in the process adjusting what data it collects
        from the user.

    :param form:
        This *MUST* be a subclass of :class:`django.forms.Form` or
        :class:`django.forms.ModelForm`. This should not be an instance of that
        subclass. The :ref:`SessionWizard <api_sessionwizard>` will use this
        class to create instances for the user. If going back in the wizard
        process, the :ref:`SessionWizard <api_sessionwizard>` will prepopulate
        the form with any cleaned data already collected.
