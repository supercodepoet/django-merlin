*Release date: 30-Nov-2010*

* Fixed the bug where existing form data was not getting populated on a GET request.
* Updated the process of process_POST to not automatically call self.clear().
  The developer of the wizard now should call self.clear() right before a

  in the process because of post processing error then the SessionWizard will
  not remove the data form session now.
